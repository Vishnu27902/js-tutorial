CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Version 3
CSS Selectors 
Element Selector
Class selector
ID Selector
Group Selector
Pseudo Selectors
Accessing Siblings (~) 
Direct Clild (>)

Node Js (JavaScript Run Time Environment)

Cross-Platform, Open-Source, Single Threaded, Asynchronous, Event Driven JavaScript Run Time Environment
V8 Engine (Chrome JavaScript and WebAssembly Engine)(Both Complier and Interpreter) -> written in c++ and high performance
CJS (Common JS) vs ES6 -> require/import
REPL -> Read Eval Print Loop (starts when node is entered in cmd)
Changing CJS to ES6 in Node Js -> package.json -> type: "module"
.env -> to Store Environmental Variables during deployment
Github -> git operations, .gitignore file purpose
NVM (Node Version Manager)
NPM (Node Package Manager) -> install, uninstall, update, update All, ~(minor), ^(patch)
package.json vs package-lock.json
Event Loop -> call Stack => Web APIs => Task Queue
Difference between Program, Process, Thread
Process, childProcess -> fork, spawn
Streams -> Chunks, pipe Method
Core Modules -> crypto, path, fs, url, path, queryString, os, http, events, libuv
Important Third Party modules-> mongoose, socket.io, jsonwebtoken, cheerio, CORS, express-session, node-mailer, multer(MIME files), date-fns, moment js, helmet js
Multer -> Multipart/form from the frontend
mongoose -> ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB
ORMs -> Squealize, Prisma (Relational -> SQL)
libuv -> Thread pool, threads
worker_threads -> Worker, parentPort (For creating Workers threads for data intensive process)
child_process -> spawn(Runs new process in same V8 engine instance), fork (create a new instance of V8 engine)
Cluster -> for parallelism (use multiple cores that are available in you System)
os.cpus (Shows the no. of available cores in the host system)
crypto -> require("crypto").randomBytes(64).toString("hex")
path -> resolve, ext, join
promisify
fs module -> unlink, read, write, append, existSync, Error File Callbacks
streams -> readable, writable, duplex, transform -> chunks
stream methods
String Formats (hex, base64 ect.,)
http -> Server Building
Events Module - on(), emit()
PORT -> Communication EndPoint of a System
StatusCodes -> 200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 401, 403, 500, 300 (Majorly Used codes)
Request Response Cycle
Session, Cookies
Props and Cons of Node js

Express Js (Server Side JavaScript Framework)

Light weight Framework, used to build scalable and robust Servers
Template Engines
MVC Pattern -> Model View Controller
Neat Folder Structure
Middleware -> req, res, next, error
express.static
express.urlencoded (FormData parsing), express.json (Request data Parsing)
express.json({limit: "100mb"}) -> To overcome 413 Error which is req size exceeded (by default 100kb) 
express.Router
Routes -> (Follows waterfall flow, supports regex)
CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) -> WhiteList, Origin, Credentials
Modules
HTTP methods -> GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD ect.,
PUT Vs PATCH, GET Vs POST
PostMan/ThunderClient (VS Code Extension) -> for API testing
export.default vs module.exports
API (Application Programming Interface)
RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API Architecture
Authentication (Session based, Token Based (JWT(Json Web Tokens)), OAuth, Passport Js) and Authorization (role based)
CRUD Operations: Create Read Update Delete (With JSON and DB)
mongoose ODM -> Schema Design, Model, Mongoose methods
Props n Concs of Express Js

React Js (JavaScript Frontend Library)

JavaScript Frontend Library, declarative, Server Side Rendering, Component Based, uses Virtual DOM, Unidirectional Control Flow, uses JSX (JavaScript and XML (Extensive Markup Language)),Manages View(V) in MVC Pattern
Supports JSX,JS,TSX,TS formats
Short Circuiting
Importing CSS in React
Functional Components :
Hooks -> useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer, useContext, useCallback, useMemo, useLayoutEffect, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect (Majorly Used)
Custom Hooks -> useWindowSize, useThrottle, useDebounce etc.,
props -> prop Drilling
Context API -> Provider, Consumer
Concept of Memoization
useEffect vs useLayoutEffect
useState vs useRef
useCallback vs useMemo
useState vs useReducer
Context API vs Redux
usePortal
Higher Order Components(HOC) 
Dynamic Input Fields
dangerouslySetInnerHTML
Memo
Redux -> Global Store -> Action, Reducer, State (Contains one Global Store)
Flow -> Dispatcher => Action => Store => View
React Router (react-router-dom) v6 -> {
    Link, useNavigate, useParams, BrowserRouter, Router, Route (Mostly Used)
}
child -> parent component (using call back) 
Bundlers => webpack ect.,
Error Boundaries => for Managing Errors
Code Splitting
Lazy Load
Error Boundaries
Suspense Component (Fallback) 
Infinite Scroll
Pagination
Skeleton Loading
Every Component must have renderComponent Method
Class Based :
Components LifeCycle Methods -> componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount
